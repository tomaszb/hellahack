MyHood (created at the Hellahack Oakland hackathon at Pandora)
=========

The purpose of this app is to create a community of music listeners which can interact with others listening around their geographic location. We use the Rdio API to create the music player and Leaflet.js to create the map. This project is incomplete as it was put together in about one day.
